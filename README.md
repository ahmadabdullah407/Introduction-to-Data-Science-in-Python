# Description:
This repository contains Ipython notebooks of assignments and tutorials used in the course [Introduction to data science in python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis),
part of [Applied Data Science using Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) from University of Michigan offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
## About This Course:
This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. 

This course should be taken before any of the other Applied Data Science with Python courses: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, Applied Machine Learning in Python, Applied Text Mining in Python, Applied Social Network Analysis in Python.

# Repository go through:
1. There are in total 5 directories in this repository.
2. 4 of these directories contains tutorials for each week individually.
3. Directory named [Assignments](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Introduction-to-Data-Science-in-Python/tree/main/Assignments) contains solution for assignments in this course.
4. Each directory further has sub directories which contains almost all the necessary files required or referred in Ipython notebook files tutorials and assignments.
5. Not all tutorials are Ipython notebooks some are in html format too.
# Reason to upload:
## Tutorials:
I have taken tutorials from course, cleaned them, added some of my personal practise in them and made them more detailed and easier to understand.If a person decides to follow tutorials in this repository instead of the ones directly in course, It will surely be easier for him to understand. 
## Assignments:
When I was doing this course, It helped me a lot in my understandings and concepts by comparing assignment approach i took and work done by other people. I am very hopefull that this would be the same for someone else.
